Bare Hands$The pen may ironically be the deadliest weapon on Earth,but the human body itself is a close second. Throughout all of mankind’s history,the training and discipline of the human body as a deadly weapon has been recognized and practiced by all cultures and civilizations. Under the brutal regimen of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, the marines of the USMC and UAC are built to be walking killing machines, even in the absence of artificial tools. Despite the body’s ability to adapt to almost any situation, such athletic diversity also demands the highest maintenance of any weapon - a poorly trained or fed body will get you nowhere - and the mouth attached to that body may get you (or someone else) put in either a cast or a coffin.$Melee_Attacks
#Fire Axe$Though Mars once had water on it millions of years ago, the iron desert is no longer an Earth-like planet in the slightest. This is why, on Mars, even the tiniest of uncontrolled fires can be a HUGE disaster. Throughout Mars City, one can find all the proper safety tools for combating fires, including extinguishers and axes. Practice proper safety precautions when using such tools.

MIXOM Beavertooth™ Chainsaw$The Beavertooth™-brand chainsaw is a rotary blade power tool (primarily designed for lumber work) that can serve as an improvised (albeit extremely messy) weapon. Early on in the development of Mars City, a shipment of chainsaws was mistakenly sent instead of a much-needed set of jackhammers. For a time, these tools served zero practical use until the construction of the Mars City Terrarium in 2097, where they are now used to harvest large trees grown in the artificial biome. Unlike the chainsaws of many previous generations, MIXOM’s design runs on a long-term electric motor rather than gas. No refuelling is necessary. $Chain_saw
