Bare Hands$The pen may ironically be the deadliest weapon on Earth,but the human body itself is a close second. Throughout all of mankind’s history,the training and discipline of the human body as a deadly weapon has been recognized and practiced by all cultures and civilizations. Under the brutal regimen of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, the marines of the USMC and UAC are built to be walking killing machines, even in the absence of artificial tools. Despite the body’s ability to adapt to almost any situation, such athletic diversity also demands the highest maintenance of any weapon - a poorly trained or fed body will get you nowhere - and the mouth attached to that body may get you (or someone else) put in either a cast or a coffin.
